== Test More

* Testing is not a cost but an investment.
* By working TDD style you typically have to write less code.

[.notes]
--
* Studies have shown that after some decrease at the beginning, +
  testing actually increases programmers productivity.

=== No Tests, No Progress

* You can't measure progress unless you test.
* A test ensures that a feature is realized.

[.notes]
--
Although tests cannot prove the absence of errors,
they can help measure the degree of done.

=== Passing tests give confidence

* Including confidence to change or experiment.

[.notes]
--
* a set of passing functional tests are a great way to enable experiments
  to improve non functional aspects such as efficiency, readability.

=== Tests Document

* A well written test is the easiest way to document how an API
 is to be used, including [red]*pre*- and post-conditions.

[.notes]
--
* Tests are an excellent way to document the use of an API.

=== Example

[source,java]
----
  String greet= greeter.greet( "Klaas" );
  assertThat(greet) // passes
      .isNotNull()
      .isNotEmpty()
      .contains( "Hello", "Klaas" );
----

[.notes]
--
* The test is trivial to write and exposes the function of the API.
* Example uses more asserts than needed, but is about readability.

=== Example

[source,java]
----
  ThrowingCallable code = () -> {
          greeter.greet(null));  // illegal use
  };

  // because it throws an NPE
  assertThrownBy( code )
     .isInstanceOf( NullPointerException.class );

* This test documents the precondition.
