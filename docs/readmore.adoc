=== The importance of reading code.

[quote, Martin Fowler, Refactoring]
Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. +
Good programmers write code that humans can understand.

* a method/class/package a day keeps the architect away.
* Visit code exhibits (good example open source).
* The naming problem. Good type (class) and method names are a boon to readability.

=== Collect good examples

*  and present to the students to study, +
  maybe as part of a bigger exercise.
* Reading a lot makes a better writer, also for code.

=== Not only writing

* Coding is not only writing.
* It is studying how elements can be combined: reading.

* about homework
* Good code is understandable code, by virtue of the names used and the easy to understand constructs.
* add reviewing code as a skill.

=== It's about Quality

* Code duplication by copy and waste makes a boring read.
* Review often, because (unit) testing is blind for writing style.
* Readable code is correct most of the time.

[.notes]
--
* Another reason to avoid *code duplication or copy and waste*: all that copied code has to be read too, which is
  both boring and a waste of reading time.
* Review code, in particular or readability, not just on functional correctness.
