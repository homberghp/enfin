== Write less

What is not written can't be wrong.

=== Think before type

* Have I done it before?
* Its there some(one|thing) that can do it for you?
* Is there a function in the lib that can do it?

* The less you write the less you err.
* Always be critical.
* A by-the-book solution might not be the best for your case.

=== Model right

* Use the proper modeling tool/technique.
* A model leaves out some details to reveal others.

[.notes]
--
* modeling should be used to discover things, not for the models sake.
* Choosing the proper diagram or paradigm is hard, but necessary.

=== Do not over model

* In many applications a data model (ERD) suffices.
* Making a object model (e.g. POJO) is often superfluous, and only adds complexity and work.
* Modeling inheritance is useless, because it will not survive the transformations

[.notes]
--
* Do not make both a ERD/database model and a object model.
* Use one source of truth. Most of the time start with the data (sausage).
* Useless transformations have no business value, but only cost, if not programmers work then cpu cycles = energy.
