== Write less

[quote]
What is not written can't be wrong.

=== Think before type

* Have I done it before?
* Its there some(one|thing) that can do it for you?
* Is there a function in the lib that can do it?

* Sit on your hands, anyone?
* The less you write the less you err.
* Always be critical.
* A by-the-book solution might not be the best for your case.

=== Model right

* Use the proper modeling tool/technique.
* A model leaves out some details to reveal others.

[.notes]
--
* modeling should be used to discover things, not for the models sake.
* Choosing the proper diagram or paradigm is hard, but necessary.

=== Do not [red]*over model*

* In many applications [green]*one* data model (the ER-model) suffices.
* Making a object model (e.g. POJO) is often superfluous, and only adds complexity and work.
* Modeling inheritance is [red]*useless*, because it will [red]*not survive the transformations*.
* Use composition a.k.a. views to get the data fit for a use case.

[.notes]
--
* Do not make both a ERD/database model and a object model.
* Use one source of truth. Most of the time start with the data (sausage).
* Useless transformations have no business value, but only cost, if not programmers work then cpu cycles = energy.
* The other layer may very well not support classes (JSON, sql) and inheritance. In those layers it is just data. Do not make more of it.

=== Model the machine instead

* Put the modeling effort in the machine.
* In many cases the machine can be designed using well known patterns.
* Actually all frameworks are chock-full of patterns.

[.notes]
--
* Effort can be focus on identifying the opportunities for patterns +
 Or Non Functional requirements like test-ability. (Layered design).

=== Advise from the industry

. make the requirements less dumb
. try and delete part of the process/product
. simplify or optimize
. accelerate cycle time
. automate
